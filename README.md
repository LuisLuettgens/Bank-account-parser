### Prerequisites

This project offers multiple ways of getting the code running. Depending on your operating system and preinstalled software you might want to choose which way works best for you.

#### Docker

If you decide to use docker for this programm to run and have not yet installed it, please follow these steps:

##### Ubuntu

To get docker running on a Ubuntu machine the follow commands should do the trick. I've tested it for Ubuntu 18.04.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Plese find more information about the installation here: [How to install docker on ubuntu 18.04](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04)

##### Other OS

Please follow the official installation guide for your operating system (Win/MacOS) from the official docker website: [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)


#### Jupyter

If you want to use your local python installation together with jupyter notebooks, this is also fine. Make sure to have at least `python3.6` installed on your machine, otherwise you might run into some errors.

##### Installation with pip

You can install Jupyter with the following command:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

If you're having `pip3` installed instead of `pip` alter the above command accordingly.

##### Installation without pip

If you prefer a GUI-based installation, the easist way to get Jupyter, is by installing the Anaconda evironment from their official website: [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). Please make sure to select the correct OS.

### Installing

#### Docker 
With this git repo comes a file called `Dockerfile`. If you docker installed on your machine, this should be the easiest way. If you're missing `docker` and want to install it, please check out the right section above.

Just run the following command inside this repository:

```
sudo docker build . --tag dkb_parser:1.0
```

If your not on a Unix-based OS, you way have to remove the `sudo` prefix.

Once this build command is finished, which may take a few minutes, you can now start a local jupyter server. This server contains the latest version of the code and comes with a necessary dependecies.

You can run this docker container (and by that the jupyter server) via:

```
sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 dkb_parser:1.0
```
Once the server is running, you should see something similar like:

```
Set username to: jovyan
usermod: no changes
Executing the command: jupyter notebook
[I 09:30:37.171 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-18-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://fe8728e7a1ed:8888/?token=1374784f2754634113c0cce106a8296fccb1036b8a44d0e1
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=1374784f2754634113c0cce106a8296fccb1036b8a44d0e1
```

Follow the instructions and paste one of these URLs into your web browser or `ctrl + click` them.

You should see the jupyter environment as shown below:

### Coding style

This project was implemented using `python3.7` and follows `Google's Style` for documentation.

### Usage

To use this tool, we have to feed it with some data. Therefore, you can download all transactions of the last three years from the DKB website. Navigate to Ums√§tze, choose the timeperiod and export the csv-file by clicking the downfacing arrow in the top right corner like in the image below.

![Export csv file](./images/DKB_Account.png)

#### Docker

Run the docker run command `sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 dkb_parser:1.0` again. After you've open the link nagivate to `/work/DKB-bank-account-parser`. and press the Upload button in the top right corner, select the previously downloaded csv-file.

**Note:** The server is running on your local machine, thus your file is _uploaded_ via an intra-machine network from your OS to the docker image so it never leaves you're machine.

Afterwards open the file: `DKB.ipynb` replace the string `/path/to/your.csv` with the acctual path to the previously downloaded csv file. Then execute the lines in order to get a feel for the capabilities of this tool.
